# Map My CBO<br>
<span style="font-size:16px;">
Map My CBO is a free public search tool designed to support partnership, collaboration, and community outreach for local organizations that work with the diverse communities of Orange County. Easy to update and free to use, the map and directory provides regional stakeholders with a unique, point-in-time view of the regional nonprofit and grassroots network, including:

<li><span style="font-size:16px;">Services provided, where and in what languages; and</li>
<li><span style="font-size:16px;">Community outreach and civic engagement capabilities</li>

<span style="font-size:16px;">This map and table directory of community-based organizations builds on outreach data collected during the 2020 Census and is searchable by city, population demographic characteristics, and outreach activities.<br>
<br>
The more organizations that are reflected in this map, the more powerful the tool can be to drive partnerships for community outreach, engagement, and activation initiatives, from public health education to benefits enrollment to the 2030 Census.<br>
