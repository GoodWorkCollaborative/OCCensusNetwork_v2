# Community Outreach Directory | Orange County<br>
<span style="font-size:16px;">
The <b>Community Outreach Directory of Orange County</b> is a public search tool for local organizations that work with the diverse communities of Orange County. <br><br>
This map and table directory of community-based organizations builds on outreach data collected during the 2020 Census and is searchable by city, population demographic characteristics, and outreach activities. <br><br>
The more organizations that are reflected in this Directory, the more powerful the tool can be to drive partnerships for community outreach, engagement, and activation initiatives, from public health education to benefits enrollment to the 2030 Census. <br><br>
